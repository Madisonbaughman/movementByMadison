                            Both! We all have physical goals, and some may struggle more than others. With my background as an OT, I can address child delays having had experience working in outpatient pediatric settings and summer programs.  But adults have movement and strength goals too!! Sometimes we neglect these and end up uncomfortable in our bodies or not able to perform to the degree we would like to be. Rehabbing clients after injury back to health and personally training those who want to achieve stronger, healthier bodies offers a “lifespan” approach which I am happy to be able to provide as a therapist and trainer.

                            I see kids with motor or coordination difficulties as well kids that may lack strength.  This includes gross and fine motor issues.  Some may have mild issues (“My child seems a little ‘clumsy.’”) and some have more severe delays.  I also see some younger children that might be a little slower to meet their milestones (rolling over, crawling etc).

                            There are a variety of options for training. I see some clients in private gyms that are only open for trainers and clients where social distancing would not be an issue. In the setting of Covid-19, outdoor locations have become a popular option. In-home or in a clients gym is also an option as is Zoom or Facetime.  A short questionnaire is given prior to the start of a session and face masks are worn when appropriate (indoor and within 6 ft of others).

                            I hear this fear a lot.  I’d rather be a teammate assisting you on your journey than a drill sergeant.  A good trainer gets to know YOU and how you are motivated best.  Grading a workout to offer just the right amount of “push” is what I try to accomplish. This can look like different things for different people.  I will always try to meet you where you are at and offer positive reinforcement.
